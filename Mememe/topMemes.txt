When you are getting off
When you trip on air in public
When you wake up in the middle of the night
When you have 6 hours left until your paper is due
When you feel like you have to go to the bathroom
When you walk into a room with someone you know in it, make eye contact
When you’re thinking inappropriate thoughts
When your friend is telling a story you have heard 50 times
When you have to go to work early
When you are dead inside
When your friend asks you to do a thing that you really don’t want to do
When you have this great idea that could change your life
When you try to put on an old pair of jeans that don’t fit
When your group of friends want to go out to eat
When you want to sit next to your crush
When you don’t feel like talking
When your barber is slowly fucking up your hair
When your friend brings another friend to hang out
When you see someone you recognize
When you should be working
When you swear you fully charged your phone before you left
When you’ve been dating for 10 years
When your friend doesn’t listen to your advice
When you’re confused on something
When you have an important decision to consider
When your friend says something stupid
When you make plans with someone
When you said you’d do something with a friend before
When you ask a group a question
When you’re trying to be mad at your friend
When you’re trying to talk
When you want to add a comment to the conversation
When you have no money
When you play the best card
When guests come to your house
When you have studied for hours
When you are dying inside
When you’re trying to work
When you watch your favorite childhood show
When you are trying to be attractive
When someone does some stupid shit in public
When your friend lets out a loud burp
When someone farts in the room
When you are constipated
When you are doing something online
When you’ve made up your mind
