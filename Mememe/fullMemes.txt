When you walk into a party and you see your ex
When you realize you ain’t shit.
When you just said the funniest line but no one is laughing
When you’re taking a dump and someone knocks on the door
When finals are here and you haven’t studied all semester
When you find out your crush is single
When you find out your crush is in a happy relationship
When you take a dump and a bit of water splashes up and hits your taint
When you go to hi five but your friend fist bumps
When you sneeze and no one says “bless you”
When you’re checking out someone and they catch you
When your team wins the game that matters
When the team you hate loses
When your friend just got married but you’re still single.
When you find out your country is not actually as great as you thought
When a customer asks you that one dumb question a 4 year old would know
When you’re giving someone directions but they end up lost and come back
When someone steps on your shoes but does not apologize
When the check comes and someone tries to get out of paying their share
When your friend is not so low key hitting on your girl
When you do something wrong but someone else is blamed
When grandma tries to figure out the latest cell phone
When your favorite thing is just released after waiting forever for it
When you’re exercising for the first time in forever
When you send a risky text and you’re not sure how it went
When you’re trying to find a movie to watch but nothing looks good
When your boss comes around and you have to pretend like you’re working
When you see that one friend that is clearly not ok but they won’t admit it
When the weather outside is frightful but you wear shorts anyway
When you ask your girl what they want to eat
When your girl tells you her plans tonight are cancelled
When your Netflix and chill is great success
When you show up with the best costume but no one knows what you are
What you really do when you tell someone you have plans
When someone calls your best friend their best friend
When your boss says you can leave early
When you have a paper, a presentation and the cure for cancer due tomorrow
When you restart the router but it still doesn’t work
When you are out driving and the check engine light comes on
When you say bye but they send you back to back texts and call you
When you are chilling at work not doing shit and your boss calls your name
When you check your bank balance and its more than zero
When the person you can’t stand is talking
When you remember snacks at the theaters are more than an arm and a leg
When you realize the word “slang” is slang for short language
When you’re with that one friend who criticizes everything they see
When someone uses your driveway to turn around
When you say some stupid shit after an awkward silence
When someone tells you that you snore for the first time
When you try to take all the groceries at once
When you try to reenact a scene of a movie
When someone starts a conversation about the thing you know the most about
When the conversation is about stuff you know absolutely nothing about
When you catch someone you don’t know in your house
