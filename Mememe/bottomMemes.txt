but don’t want anyone to know
and your mom walks in
and you feel something wet in your pants
but you haven’t started yet.
but when you’re there you can’t go
but neither of you say hi.
and wonder if anyone can tell.
but you still try to look interested.
but you stayed up way too late last night
but you say yes anyway
only to find out it has already been invented.
but you’re gonna try anyways.
but no one wants to decide
but someone else quickly takes the seat
but your significant other keeps trying to start a conversation
but you just accept your fate and decide to move to China and change your identity.
and they get along better than you do.
but can’t quite figure out where from
but you decide to prsocrastinate instead
but its dead 15 minutes later anyway
and she is already saying “I love you”
and comes back to you after failing
but don’t ask because you think your question would be dumb
and don’t want to be interrupted
and no one calls them out on it
and they tell you last minute they can’t come
but now you really don’t want to.
and no one says shit
but they are too nice
but some loud person won’t shut up
and are patiently waiting for a pause
but want to window shop anyway
but someone else wins
but you're too shy
but you have nothing in common
but still have hours left to go
but still want to put up a front
but that one show is on and it’s hard to resist
but it is terrible
but you have no idea how
and you be just like…
but doesn’t say anything after
and no one is sure who did it
but still want to try
but you have to be somewhere else
but pretend you’re thinking about it.
